# OLX Clone
This repository contains the implementation of an OLX clone application, built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM (Object-Document Mapping). The project allows users to create, edit, and delete ads after logging in, along with a search functionality to filter ads by specific criteria.

# Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to manage user accounts.
Create Ads: Logged-in users can post new ads to sell products or services.
Edit and Delete Ads: Ads can be edited or deleted, but only by the user who created them.
Search Ads: Users can search for ads based on keywords and filter results based on predefined categories or tags.
Responsive Design: The application is built with Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive and mobile-friendly interface.
MongoDB Integration: All ad data and user information are stored in MongoDB using Mongoose for efficient database interaction.
# Technologies Used
Next.js: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making the app fast and SEO-friendly.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and allows for quick UI development.
Express.js: A minimal web application framework for building robust and scalable server-side logic.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data and ads information.
Mongoose: A popular Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, simplifying data validation, query building, and database operations.
